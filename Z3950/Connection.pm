=head1 NAME

Net::Z3950::Connection - Connection to a Z39.50 server, with request queue

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	$conn = new Net::Z3950::Connection($hostname, $port);
	$rs = $conn->search('au=kernighan and su=unix');
	# or
	$mgr = $conn->manager();
	$conn = $mgr->wait();
	if ($mgr->failed()) {
		die "error " . $conn->errcode() .
			"( " . $conn->addinfo() . ")" .
			" in " . Net::Z3950::opstr($conn->errop());
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A connection object represents an established connection to a
particular server on a particular port, together with options such as
the default database in which to search.  It maintains a queue of
outstanding requests (searches executed against it, fetches executed
against result sets instantiated against it) I<etc.>

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

	$conn = new Net::Z3950::Connection($mgr, $host, $port);
	$conn = new Net::Z3950::Connection($host, $port);
	$conn = new Net::Z3950::Connection($mgr, "unix", $path);
	$conn = new Net::Z3950::Connection("unix", $path);

Creates and returns a new connection, under the control of the manager
I<$mgr>, to the server on the specified I<$host> and I<$port>.  If the
I<$port> argument is omitted, the C<z3950> service is used; if this is
not defined, port 210 is used.

The manager argument may be omitted, in which
case, the connection is created under the control of a
``default manager'', a reference to which may be subsequently
retrieved with the C<manager()> method.  Multiple connections made
with no explicitly-specified manager in this way will all share the
same implicit manager.  The default manager is initially in
synchronous mode.  If you don't understand what this paragraph is on
about, you should feel free to ignore it.

Unix-domain socket connections can be made by specifying C<unix> as
the hostname and the path to the socket file as the port.

If the connection is created in synchronous mode, (or, if the
constructor call doesn't specify a mode, if the manager controlling
the new connection is synchronous), then the constructor does not
return until either the connection is forged or an error occurs in
trying to do so.  (In the latter case, error information is stored in
the manager structure.)  If the connection is asynchronous, then the
new object is created and returned before the connection is forged;
this will happen in parallel with subsequent actions.

I<This is a lie: connecting is always done synchronously.>

If a connection cannot be forged, then C<$!> contains an error code
indicating what went wrong: this may be one of the usual system error
codes such as ECONNREFUSED (if there is no server running at the
specified address); alternatively, it may be set to the distinguished
value -1 if the TCP/IP connection was correctly forged, but the Z39.50
C<Init> failed.

Any of the standard options (including asynchronous
mode) may be specified as additional arguments.  Specifically:

	$conn = new Net::Z3950::Connection($mgr, $host, $port, async => 1);

Works as expected.

=head2 option()

	$value = $conn->option($type);
	$value = $conn->option($type, $newval);

Returns I<$conn>'s value of the standard option I<$type>, as
registered in I<$conn> itself, in the manager which controls it, or in
the global defaults.

If I<$newval> is specified, then it is set as the new value of that
option in I<$conn>, and the option's old value is returned.

}


=head2 manager()

	$mgr = $conn->manager();

Returns a reference to the manager controlling I<$conn>.  If I<$conn>
was created with an explicit manager, then this method will always
return that function; otherwise, it returns a reference to the single
global ``default manager'' shared by all other connections.

=cut

=head2 startSearch()

	$conn->startSearch($srch);

	$conn->startSearch(-prefix => '@and @attr 1=1 kernighan @attr 1=21 unix');
	$conn->startSearch('@and @attr 1=1 kernighan @attr 1=21 unix');

Inititiates a new search against the Z39.50 server to which I<$conn>
is connected.  Since this can never fail (:-), it C<die()s> if
anything goes wrong.  But that will never happen.  (``Surely the odds
of that happening are million to one, doctor?'')

The query itself can be specified in a variety of ways:

=over 4

=item *

A C<Net::Z3950::Query> object may be passed in.

=item *

A query-type option may be passed in, together with the query string
itself as its argument.  Currently recognised query types are C<-ccl>
(using the standard CCL query syntax, interpreted by the server),
C<-ccl2rpn> (CCL query compiled by the client into a type-1 query) and
C<-prefix> (using Index Data's prefix query notation, described at
http://indexdata.dk/yaz/doc/tools.php#PQF ).

=item *

A query string alone may be passed in.  In this case, it is
interpreted according to the query type previously established as a
default for I<$conn> or its manager.

=back

The various query types are described in more detail in the
documentation of the C<Net::Z3950::Query> class.

I<### The Query class does not yet, and might never, exist.>

Some broken Z39.50 server will fault a search but not provide any
diagnostic records.  The correct fix for this problem is of course to
poke the providers of those servers in the back of the knee with a
teaspoon until they fix their products.  But since this is not always
practical, C<Net::Z3950> provides a dummy diagnostic record in this
case, with error-code 3 (``unsupported search'') and additional
information set to ``no diagnostic records supplied by server''.

	if ($conn->op() == Net::Z3950::Op::Error) {
		print "error number: ", $conn->errcode(), "\n";
		print "error message: ", $conn->errmsg(), "\n";
		print "additional info: ", $conn->errcode(), "\n";
		print "in function: ", Net::Z3950::opstr($conn->errop()), "\n";
	}

When an error is known to have occurred on a connection, the error
code (from the BIB-1 diagnosic set) can be retrieved via the
C<errcode()> method, any additional information via the C<addinfo()>
method, and the operation that was being attempted when the error
occurred via the C<errop()> method.  (The error operation returned
takes one of the values that may be returned from the C<op()> method.)

The meanings of the BIB-1 diagnostics are described at on the Z39.50
Maintenance Agency web-site at
http://lcweb.loc.gov/z3950/agency/defns/bib1diag.html

As a convenience, C<$conn->errmsg()> is equivalent to
C<Net::Z3950::errstr($conn->errcode())>.

=head2 initResponse()

	if ($op == Net::Z3950::Op::Init) {
		$rs = $conn->initResponse();

When a connection is known to have received an init response, the
response may be accessed via the connection's C<initResponse()>
method.

=cut

sub initResponse {
    my $this = shift();
    die "not init response" if $this->op() != Net::Z3950::Op::Init;
    return $this->{initResponse};
}


=head2 searchResponse(), resultSet()

	if ($op == Net::Z3950::Op::Search) {
		$sr = $conn->searchResponse();
		$rs = $conn->resultSet();

When a connection is known to have received a search response, the
response may be accessed via the connection's C<searchResponse()>, and
the search result may be accessed via the connection's C<resultSet()>
method.

=cut

sub searchResponse {
    my $this = shift();
    die "not search response" if $this->op() != Net::Z3950::Op::Search;
    return $this->{searchResponse};
}

sub resultSet {
    my $this = shift();
    die "not search response" if $this->op() != Net::Z3950::Op::Search;
    return $this->{resultSet};
}


=head2 resultSets()

	@rs = $conn->resultSets();

Returns a list of all the result sets that have been created across
the connection I<$conn> and have not subsequently been deleted.

=cut

sub resultSets {
    my $this = shift();

    return @{$this->{resultSets}};
}


=head2 name()

	print $conn->name();

Returns a short string which can be used as the connection's "name" in
text output.

=cut

sub name {
    my $this = shift();

    return $this->{host} . ':' . $this->{port};
}


=head2 close()

	$conn->close();

This lets the C<Net::Z3950> module know that you no longer want to use
C<$conn> so it can be closed.  It would be nice if this could be done
implicitly when C<$conn> goes out of scope, as in:

	{
	    $conn = new Net::Z3950::Connection($host, $port);
	    $rs = $conn->search($query);
	    print "found ", $rs->size(), " records\n";
	}

But in general this won't work, because C<$conn> is not the only
reference to the connection object: when it goes out of scope, the
connection is not destroyed because its manager still holds a
reference to it.  So use C<$conn->close()> (just before the close
brace in the example above) to let the connection know it's done with.

=cut

sub close {
    my $this = shift();

    my $mgr = delete $this->{mgr};
    $mgr->forget($this) if defined $mgr; ### but it should always be!

    $this->{idleWatcher}->cancel() if defined $this->{idleWatcher};
    $this->{readWatcher}->cancel() if defined $this->{readWatcher};
    $this->{writeWatcher}->cancel() if defined $this->{writeWatcher};

    # XXX for a V.3 connection, we should really send a closeRequest
    # and await a closeResponse, but thats a lot of extra coding effort
    # for very little gain. A server that can't cope with an
    # abrupty-severed connection isn't going to last for long in the real
    # world....

    if (defined $this->{cs}) {
	Net::Z3950::yaz_close($this->{cs});
    }

    # lots of the elements of %$this directly or indirectly contain
    # copies of $this. By deleting all elements from the hash, we hope
    # to break all circular references.

    %$this = ();
    $this->{closed} = 1;
}


sub DESTROY {
    my $this = shift();

    #warn "destroying Net::Z3950 Connection $this";

    $this->close() unless $this->{closed};
