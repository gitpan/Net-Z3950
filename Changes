Revision history for Perl extension Net::Z3950.

0.12  Wed Feb 21 16:47:03 2001
	- Change my email address and web-page in the README.
	- Add conditionally-compiled debugging code to Yaz-wrapper.
	- Add rudimentary support for rendering MARC records and
	  remove the MARC-related apology from the tutorial.
	- Add note to README about "make test" error message.
	- Add note to README about support options, including the
	  Net::Z3950 mailing list.

0.11  Fri Feb  9 11:31:34 2001
	- Fix Net::Z3950::ResultSet->record() to work correctly in
	  synchronous mode (i.e. wait for the record to become
	  available before returning.)
	- Add rawdata() method to the various Net::Z3950::Record::*
	  classes: we now have a distinction between render() and
	  rawdata(), concepts which were previously mulched in
	  together very unhelpfully.
	- Add Tutorial.
	- FIRST PUBLIC RELEASE ON CPAN

0.10  Wed Nov 29 16:39:47 2000
	- Change module name from Z3950 to Net::Z3950

0.04  Fri Sep 22 17:51:28 2000
	- Fix so that diagnostics are available after search failure.
	- Add trivial "straight through" support for USMARC and some
	  of the related record syntaxes.
	- Support for OID-typed fields in GRS-1 records.
	- Change default database to "Default" (it had the profoundly
	  unhelpful default of "hardwired-databaseName"!)
	- Modify the internal class hierarchy to make MARC support
	  hang together more easily (yazwrap library now returns
	  ...::Record::<RS> objects instead of ...::APDU::<RS>)
	- Improve diagnostics when low-level translation of C objects
	  into Perl objects fails.

0.03  Thu Jun 29 15:38:33 2000
	- First version to be held in CVS at indexdata.dk
	- Add CVS identification headers where they're missing, fix
	  some that lacked the trailing $-sign (duh.)
	- Fix the search() and records() wrapper methods so that much
	  simpler single-threaded clients can be easily written.

0.02  Tue Jun 27 21:28:56 2000
	- Make the $port argument optional in the Z3950::Connection
	  constructor.
	- Add support for mnchar* (T_MNPV) to the typemap file: this
	  is a Maybe-Null PV, into which undefined values may be
	  passed yielding null pointers.
	- Add samples/fetch1.pl, which actually works (unlike the
	  other scripts in the samples directory, which are written to
	  a pre-0.1 version of the interface.)
	- Remove obsolete bits of the README file.

0.01  Tue May 23 09:20:30 2000
	- Originally created by h2xs 1.19
	- 0.01 was the first numbered version.  Earlier versions were
	  never assigned numbers as they never got outside the
	  author's house; this is the first one that was sent to Index
	  Data.
