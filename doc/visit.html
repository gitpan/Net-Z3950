<h1>ZZPerl - Perl interface to Z39.50</h1>

<h2>Class Hierarchy</h2>

<p>
All classes defined by the Z3950 Perl module (note the absence of the
dot - this really is a Perl module name) are of the form
<i>Z3950::*</i>.

<h3>Z3950::Manager</h3>

<p>
This encapsulate the Z3950 module's global state - option for search
parsing, preferred record syntaxes, compiled configuration files,
<i>etc.</i> - as well as a list of references to all the open
connections.  We would normally expect there to be just one of these,
but I suppose there's no reason why you shouldn't make more if you
want.

<h3>Z3950::Connection</h3>

<p>
Represents an established connection to a particular server on a
particular port, together with options such as the default database in
which to search.  Maintains a record of all outstanding requests, and
maybe - why not? - history of previous requests.

<p>
(Could have this merely store information and not actually do the the
INIT until you do a search.)

<h3>Z3950::Search</h3>

<p>
Represents a compiled search, ready to be sent to a server.  May be
built by calling a constructor to compile a search command (e.g. using
CCL with a specified set of qualifiers) or Index Data's prefix
notation; or a Type-1 or 101 query may be built "by hand" by creating
an composing nodes of type <b>Z3950::Search::Type1</b> and promoting
the top-level node to a fully-fledged <b>Z3950::Search</b>.

<h3>Z3950::ResultSet</h3>

<p>
Represents the result of executing a search against a specific
database on a specific connection, and contains an ordered list of
zero or more elements each of which is either a record or a surrogate
diagnostic (see below).

<h3>Z3950::Record</h3>

<p>
This is an abstract type, in the sense that it is never actually
instantiated.  Instead, it is used as a base class - really an
interface specification - for a variety of concrete derivatives, of
which the most interesting are:

<ul>
<li><b>Z3950::Record::SUTRS</b>
<li><b>Z3950::Record::USMARC</b>
<li><b>Z3950::Record::DANMARC</b>
<li><i>etc.</i>
<li><b>Z3950::Record::GRS1</b>
<li><b>Z3950::Record::XML</b>
</ul>

<p>
(Alternatively, the various <b>*MARC</b> record types could be
represented as <b>Z3950::Record::MARC::US</b> <i>etc.</i>)

<p>
Each of these record types defines standard methods for operations
such as as ``what's your type?'' and ``render yourself''.

<p>
An obvious starting point would be to implement SUTRS only - it's easy
to translate a C-level SUTRS record (basically a string) into a Perl
version.

<p>
The various MARC formats could perhaps also be dealt with trivially by
simply returning a flat block of data to be interpreted by a
pre-existing MARC package - is there such a beast on CPAN?

<p>
The real challenge of course is translating GRS-1 records from Yaz's
format into Perl data structures: this will presumably require us to
define yet more types such as Z3950::Record::GRS1::Element and build
recursive trees reflecting the GRS-1 ASN.1 in Appendix RET.

<p>
XML records can be passed through "as it".

<h3>Z3950::Diagnostic</h3>

<p>
Represents a surrogate diagnostic occurring  in a result set in place
of a record.  (Non-surrogate diagnostics do not have an explicit
representation - they are indicated by methods returning an undefined
value and storing error information in the object.)

<h3>Future Directions</h3>

<p>
The type system described in this document provides an interface to
only four Z39.50 services - INIT, SEARCH, PRESENT and (implicitly)
CLOSE.  A future version could also provide objects to invoke SCAN,
EXTENDED SERVICES, <i>etc.</i>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>
This system appears simple and indeed obvious.  Is that because it's
trivial, or is it just elegantly minimal and generally perfect?  (And
do those two options even conflict?)

<h2>GRS-1 Interface</h2>

<p>
Apart from the obvious traversal functions, we want to be able to say:

<ul>
<li>Get me all top-level elements tagged (2,1)
<li>Get me all elements with tag-path (2,1)/(4,2)/(1,1)
<li>zthes-like selection by related element.
</ul>

<h2>Simple Client Code</h2>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
use Z3950;
$conn = new Z3950::Connection('indexdata.dk');
$rs = $conn-&gt;search('au=kernighan');
foreach $rec ($rs-&gt;records()) {
	print $rec-&gt;render();
}
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<h2>Multiplexing Client Code</h2>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
use Z3950;
$mgr = new Z3950::Manager(-mode =&gt; 'async');
my @conn;
foreach $host ('indexdata.dk', 'tecc.co.uk') {
	push @conn, $mgr-&gt;startConnect($host);
}
foreach $conn (@conn) {
	$conn-&gt;startSearch('au=kernighan');
}
while ($conn = $mgr-&gt;wait()) {
	if ($conn-&gt;failed()) {
		die "error " . $conn-&gt;errcode() .
			"( " . $conn-&gt;addinfo() . ")" .
			" in " . $conn-&gt;where();
	}
	$op = $conn-&gt;op();
	if ($op == Z3950::Op::Search) {
		$rs = $conn-&gt;resultSet();
		$size = $rs-&gt;size();
		$rs-&gt;startGet(1, $size);
	} elsif ($op == Z3950::Op::Get) {
		foreach $rec ($conn-&gt;records()) {
		print $rec-&gt;render();
	}
}
