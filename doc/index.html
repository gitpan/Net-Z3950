  <H1>Net::Z3950 - Perl extension for talking to Z39.50 servers</H1>

  <H2>Why a Documentation Directory?</H2>
  <P>
  For a while, I experimented with having the HTML form of the POD
  documents living alongside the Perl source, but that turns out to be
  Hard To Do right - you end up fighting the MakeMaker - so I decided
  it wasn't worth the effort, and moved all the documentation into
  this separate directory, where the building of the HTML is
  controlled by a simple <A href="Makefile">Makefile</A>.

  <H2>User Documents</H2>
  <P>
  The bulk of the documentation is from the PODs in the source files:
  it is intended to provide everything that a user of the Net::Z3950 module
  could need to know.
  <P>
  It should be read in the following order:
  <UL>
   <LI><A href="Z3950.html">Net::Z3950 module overview</A>
   <LI><A href="Z3950/Tutorial.html">Tutorial</A>
   <LI><A href="Z3950/Manager.html">The Net::Z3950::Manager class</A>
   <LI><A href="Z3950/Connection.html">The Net::Z3950::Connection class</A>
   <LI><A href="Z3950/ResultSet.html">The Net::Z3950::ResultSet class</A>
   <LI><A href="Z3950/Record.html">The Net::Z3950::Record class</A>
   <LI><A href="Z3950/Options.html">Standard options <B>(NOT YET)</B></A>
   <LI><A href="Z3950/APDU.html">The Net::Z3950::APDU class</A>
	<I>(Don't bother reading this)</I>
  </UL>
  <P>
  Yes, it's ridiculous that I need to provide this hand-maintained
  index.  What I should clearly do is have the SEE ALSO section of the
  top-level Net::Z3950 overview manual link to all the other manuals
  describing specific data types.  Unfortunately (can you believe this?)
  I can't find any construct in POD which converts to a simple relative
  link in HTML.
  <P>
  Other things that may be worth reading:
  <UL>
   <LI>Thoughts about <A href="gui.html">putting a GUI on Net::Z950/Perl
	applications</A>
   <LI>Notes about <A href="todo.html">work still to be done</A>
  </UL>

  <H2>Developer Documents</H2>
  <P>
  There are a few additional bits and pieces that may be of interest
  to people who want to develop the module further:
  <UL>
   <LI><A href="visit.html">Early documentation</A> written on
	the bus and plane to visit Index Data in Denmark, and
	including some notes added during the discussions there, of
	which the most interesting are the revised interface
	sketches.  <B>Please understand that this is out of date, and
	of historical interest only</B>
   <LI>A list of the <A href="Albums">music</A> that I listened
	to while I was writing it.  (OK, I admit it has a lot of
	mid-seventies semi-metal crud in it.  That's because I did the
	work in my office at home, which has an old-fashioned
	turntable in it, and gives me a rare opportunity to revive my
	teen years with the aid of all that obsolete vinyl that's
	gathering dust in the corner.  Also, if I were coming over all
	sentimental, I might comment on how certain songs on the Chris
	De Burgh album present an achingly resonant insight into the
	ephemerality of human life, the noble tragedy of the world's
	continuous losses as people grow old and die, and the human
	condition generally.  But hey, this is supposed to be a
	technical document, so I won't mention any of that stuff.)
