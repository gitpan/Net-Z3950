canonical.pl	The most trivial complete program: fetch and print a record
fetch1.pl	Like canonical.pl but with rudimentary error checking
simple.pl	Similar, but takes command-line args and prints all records
batch-isbn.pl	Fetch a batch of records with ISBNs taken from names file
multiplex.pl	Searches concurrently across multiple servers
